    <hr>
    <p>It is not possible to transfer a ticket from one account to another. Instead, you can edit your order information to put your ticket under someone elseâ€™s name and email address. This does not remove the ticket from your Eventbrite account, but the new attendee will receive an email prompting them to claim tickets when you save the change. If you purchased tickets from a third-party seller (not the event listing) or had tickets purchased on your behalf, you won't be able to log in and update the information on the original order. The original ticket buyer needs to perform the transfer in this case or contact the event organizer for assistance.</p>
