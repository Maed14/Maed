    <hr>
    <p>When you order tickets on Eventfrenzy, an account is created using the email address you enter during checkout. To access your tickets, log in to the Eventfrenzy app or website using the email on your order.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Where to find your tickets</h2>
    <p>You can access your tickets in your account via the EventFrenzy website.</p>
    <p>The EventFrenzy website: Log in and go to Tickets.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>If you’re unable to log in</h2>
    <p>You might not have a password yet. During checkout, Eventbrite creates an account for you using the email address you provide. To verify your email and access your tickets:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>On the EventFrenzy log in page. Select Forgot password.</li>
        <li>Enter your email address and answer security question.</li>
        <li>Select Reset password.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>If your tickets are missing</h2>
    <p>There are a few reasons tickets might not appear in your Eventbrite account:</p>
    <p>Different email address: You’re logged into EventFrenzy using a different email address than the one you used to place the order.</p>
    <p>Typo in your email address: The email address on your order was misspelled during checkout.</p>
