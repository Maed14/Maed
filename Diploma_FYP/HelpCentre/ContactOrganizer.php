    <p>EventFrenzy is a self-service platform, which means third party organizers create and manage their own events. If you have questions about an event, see if the information you need is on the event listing.
         If you don’t find what you’re looking for, select Contact the organizer on the event listing. If you already have a ticket, you can also contact the organizer by going to Tickets in your EventFrenzy's account.
          EventFrenzy can't answer questions about an event on the organizer's behalf.</p>
